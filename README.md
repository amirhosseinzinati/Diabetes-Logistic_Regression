# Project Description
This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset used in this project is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The dataset consists of several diagnostic measurements such as glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and the outcome variable which is a binary variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not.

In this project, logistic regression is used to build a predictive model that can accurately classify patients as diabetic or not. Logistic regression is a probabilistic model that is commonly used for binary classification problems. The model is trained on the dataset and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The dataset consists of 768 instances and 9 attributes. All patients in the dataset are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The attributes in the dataset are:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
